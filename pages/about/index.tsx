            From a very young age, I had this DEEP DOWN feeling that if <br />I
            wanted something strongly enough, that I would find a way <br />
            to get it.

            My stubborn nature and creative imagination led me to <br />
            accomplish and receive anything and everything I set my
            <br /> mind to. If I wanted something I put my energy into it, and
            <br />
            it happened simple as that.
